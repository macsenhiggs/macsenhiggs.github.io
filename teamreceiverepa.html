                                    <p>The production of NFL pass catchers relies heavily on their surrounding offensive environment. The success of a wide receiver, tight end, or running back
                                         in the passing game is heavily dependent on their quarterback's ability to get them the ball, so it would be unfair to judge them against each other without
                                         considering the circumstances they play in. The goal of this project is to recontextualize individual performance for pass catchers to identify league-wide patterns in efficiency
                                        in addition to specific players who stand out amongst their teammates, for reasons good or bad.</em></p>

                                    <h3>Methodology</h3>
                                    <p>Receiving efficiency was measured via Expected Points Added (EPA) per target. EPA is the difference in a team's expected points (EP) scored 
                                        on single drive after a play vs. before a play. Down (e.g. 1st, 2nd, etc.) and distance (e.g. 10 yards to go) are the two key factors that decide
                                        a team's EP before each play, so picking up yardage in a manner that advances your team towards scoring is the key to high-EPA plays.
                                        I calculated the average passing EPA for all 32 NFL teams as well as the average EPA when targeted for all pass-catchers who were targeted on more than 
                                        10% of their team's passing plays to create the dataset used in my plot. The minimum target share can be modified to increase or decrease the amount of data on display
                                        for future use, but a value of 0.1 appeared best for a sample spanning one season, as it generally displayed the top 2-4 pass-catchers on each team. </p>

                                        </div>

                                    <p>Since each player's efficiency factors into their team's overall efficiency, it is no surprise that there is a clear positive correlation
                                        between individual and team performance. However, the most interesting details come from the discrepancies in efficiency among teammates.
                                        There is a general trend in efficiency based on position played. Running backs are generally less efficient in the passing game than
                                        tight ends, with wide receivers generally falling in between the two. Of course, there are some exceptions to this trend. For example, Bijan Robinson and Breece Hall,
                                        two RBs who are exceptional in the passing game, were the only qualified players at their position to lead their team in receiving efficiency.
                                        Another oddity appears when examining the Minnesota Vikings' pass-catchers. The team struggled to pass the ball mightily in 2025 with inconsistent quarterback play,
                                        but it is nonetheless shocking to see Justin Jefferson, a consensus top wide receiver, boasting an EPA/target of -0.10, the lowest on his team.
                                        Perhaps there were mentality or chemistry issues involved that hindered Jefferson's production in 2025, but it is certainly concerning for Vikings fans heading into next season.
